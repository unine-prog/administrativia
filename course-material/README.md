## Course Material

This document explains how to clone the course material in [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/) and setup the environment to run the Jupyter notebooks.

### Deploy Key

The course material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a private repository, accessible only with a *Deploy Key*. This will be provided at the beginning of the course.

### Virtual Environment

The Jupyter notebooks require some Python modules that are not installed by default in Noto, like `yfinance` or `eurostatapiclient`. The recommendend way of installing third party modules in Python is to set up a virtual environment. This is the only way that will work in [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/).

To setup a suitable `programming` environment and an associated `Programming` Jupyter kernel, you can simply clone this repository in [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the public repository, follow these steps:

1. Login to [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/).
   
3. Ensure you are working in the root (home) folder `/`
